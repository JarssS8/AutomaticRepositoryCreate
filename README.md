# ðŸ“• Description ðŸ“•
This is a project for create automatically a repository from console in Github with a LICENSE and README.
It is a simple and powerfull idea where you can choose the title, the description and the privacity of the repository.

# ðŸ“– How to use ðŸ“–
The structure is REPO_NAME FLAGS [DESCRIPTION]
If the REPO_NAME or the DESCRIPTION have more than ONE word should go between ""
Order of the flags is indiferent and must start with '-'
Flags could be:
    p for make it private, for default is public
    d for add a description after the flags
Example: TestName -dp "This is the example for the description"

# ðŸ“‚ Installation ðŸ“‚

First of all you have to clone the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JarssS8/AutomaticRepositoryCreate.git
```

I prefer use a Python virtual enviroment for make it more clean.
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install virtual enviroment.

If you don't have it, you can download pasting this on a terminal:

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

After that you can create your vitual enviroment with:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
The last venv is the name of the virtual enviroment, you can choose other if you want.

Then we have to access to the venv, for that we open a terminal in ours project folder and type:
```bash
source ./venv/bin/activate
```
Now we can see we are in the virtual enviroment because the first word in our terminas is (venv)

For install all the dependencies on the venv we type:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The next step is create a JSON file with our Github credentials, something like this:
```json
{
    "username" : "my_username", 
    "password" : "my_password"
}
```
** CHANGE THE PATHS IN MAIN.PY FOR YOUR REPOSITORIES FOLDER AND YOUR CREDENTIALS FILE**

Now we have to write a bash script for can run the python script from console and after that opens Visual Studio Code with our folder:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

source /home/jars/Programming/Python/GithubAPI/venv/bin/activate && python3 /home/jars/Programming/Python/GithubAPI/main.py $@ && deactivate
code /home/jars/Programming/Autocreated/$1
```

The last step is create an alias in our .bashrc with the path of our bash script:
```bash
alias create='bash /home/jars/Programming/Python/GithubAPI/script.sh'
```
If you logout and login all should be ok. And now you can create your repositories using your console.
You can use the github credentials store for don't have to write your credentials everytime that you want create a new project, presonally I recommend this guide: https://www.shellhacks.com/git-config-username-password-store-credentials
